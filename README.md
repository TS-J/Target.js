# Target.js

#### The project is not completed. To view the progress, please move to the [Main](https://github.com/TS-J/Main) repository.

Target.js is an extension and encapsulation of jQuery, which aims to quickly build cross browser interactive web pages. It makes it easy to manipulate editable elements, user selection, and so on.We also extends some methods in jQuery, and some methods are even compatible with IE4!

## Features

 - One File
 - Compatible with IE6
 - Standard
 - Light and Extensible

## Objective

This plug-in is not to extend the UI or function, it is to unify and standardize some special functions with different browser support levels, so as to greatly facilitate developers to extend. Well, trying to be IE4 compatible may not be very common, but it's really achievable.

These extensions are mostly experimental. They make the standard interface more compatible, which is equivalent to the middle layer from the actual function to the standard interface. it's used for building a custom plug-in faster, and this extension makes it easier to do so.
